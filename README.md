<h1> Albrook </h1>
<h2> NOT IN DEVELOPMENT </h2>
I worked on this project over a few weeks back in 2019. Then I started graduate school and lost all time for development. At that time there were no good options for self hosted audiobooks so I had always intended to come back and finish this project. However, over the last year <a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org/">Audiobookshelf</a> has become exactly what I wanted albrook to be. I recommend everyone use and support that project!

<h2> Description </h2>
Albrook is a self hosted audiobook service. Obviously no audiobooks are included, you have to provide your own mp3 files. The point of albrook is simiar to the point of something like booksonic. I found that while booksonic is a great program, it lacked some of the features I wanted, and it was not as stable as I might like.

<h2> Features </h2>

    1.) Audiobook web server
    2.) Web client

This software is in its very early versions and is currently <em> totally </em> unusable as an audiobook serivice yet, eventually it will be, but not yet!
